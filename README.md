## 📖 About This Project
This project represents the **beginning of my web development journey**.  
At the time, I didn’t fully understand version control or GitHub, so it stayed hidden in my computer folders.  
Now, with more experience in Git, GitHub, and hosting, I’ve deployed it to showcase my growth.
